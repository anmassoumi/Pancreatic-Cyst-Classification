# Pancreatic-Cyst-Classification

I worked in the Cancer Physics and Engineering Lab under Dr. Eugene J. Koay, M.D., Ph.D., and Ph.D. researcher David Martinus, B.S., where I contributed to the development of an automated machine learning pipeline for the classification of pancreatic cysts. The goal of the project was to distinguish between high-grade and low-grade cysts, a clinically significant task since early and accurate identification can influence treatment decisions and patient outcomes. Using arterial phase CT scans, I applied PyRadiomics to extract a large set of quantitative radiomic features that capture subtle image-based patterns not easily identifiable by clinicians. To reduce dimensionality and isolate the most predictive features, I employed feature selection techniques including LASSO regression and Sequential Backward Selection, which ensured that the model emphasized only the most relevant characteristics. Because Sequential Backward Selection is a model specfic feature selection method, a machine learning classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, was utilized in order to compare performance and select the most predicitive subset of features. The refined features were then used to train and evaluate on  a machine learning classifier, neural networks, allowing for performance comparisons across different algorithmic approaches. This fully automated pipeline was designed to address the limitations of subjective clinical guidelines by providing a reproducible, data-driven framework for cyst classification, with the potential to be integrated into clinical workflows for improved diagnostic consistency and efficiency.

Due to the protection of the integrity of the research conducted in the labs and to respect the ownership of the faculty mentors, the work done (Machine Learning MATLAB Script & Poster) cannot be shared publicly.
